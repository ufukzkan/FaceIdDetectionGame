Even to access our phones, we need to have our facial features sensed point by point, creating a map with this data, and comparing it with the data in its memory for identity verification.

But today, we are here to try to deceive this system. If we succeed, we will inform the authorities of the renowned phone brand, Mapple, to fix the vulnerabilities. We need your help on this challenging and deceptive journey.
Come on!"
